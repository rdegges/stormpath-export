Stormpath is Joining Okta
-------------------------

We are incredibly excited to announce that `Stormpath is joining forces with Okta <https://stormpath.com/blog/stormpaths-new-path?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm-campaign=okta-announcement>`. Please visit `the Migration FAQs <https://stormpath.com/oktaplusstormpath?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm-campaign=okta-announcement>` for a detailed look at what this means for Stormpath users.

We're available to answer all questions at `support@stormpath.com <mailto:support@stormpath.com>`.


Purpose
-------

`Stormpath`_ is one of my favorite API services. They provide a scalable,
simple, and secure user management API which makes building scalable systems
simple.

Whenever I talk to people about using `Stormpath`_, the same question
invariably comes up: "Is it easy to export my user data out of Stormpath?  Or
am I locked in?"

Up until now, the answer has been "Yes! But only if you contact them about it."

With ``stormpath-export``, however, you can easily back up all your Stormpath
user data instantly!

``stormpath-export`` will:

- Grab all Stormpath data you've stored, and dump it to JSON files locally.
- Dump data into a local directory structure which makes intuitive sense
  (*groups are located in the groups directory, etc.*).
- Each object gets it's own JSON file generated. This makes it easy to look at
  the file system and extract the information you need.

``stormpath-export`` makes it easy to:

- Download a copy of all your user data.
- Back up your user data (*Stormpath has their own backups of course, but you
  can never be too safe*).
- Migrate user data out of Stormpath.


Installation
------------

Installing ``stormpath-export`` is simple -- just use `pip`_!

Once you have pip installed on your computer, you can run the following to
install the latest release of ``stormpath-export``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U stormpath-export

That's it :)


Usage
-----

Before you can export all your `Stormpath`_ data, you'll need to configure
``stormpath-export`` and give it your Stormpath API credentials. To do this,
simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ stormpath-export configure

This will prompt you for some basic information, then store your credentials
in the local file ``~/.stormy``.

NOTE: If you are using Stormpath Enterprise, please enter
``https://enterprise.stormpath.io/v1`` when prompted for the Base URL.  This
instructs the export tool to talk to the Stormpath Enterprise environment.

Next, to initiate a backup job, you can run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ stormpath-export

This will export all your Stormpath data, and dump it into a new directory
named ``stormpath-exports``. If you'd like to specify your own backup location,
you can do so by adding a path -- for instance:

.. code-block:: console

    $ stormpath-export ~/Desktop/stormpath-exports

When exporting your data, you should see output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: console

    === Exporting all application data...
    - Exporting application: Stormpath
    === Done!

    === Exporting all directory data...
    - Exporting directory: Stormpath Administrators
    - Exporting directory: testdirectory
    === Done!

    === Exporting all group data...
    - Exporting group: Administrators
    === Done!

    === Exporting all account data...
    - Exporting account: r@rdegges.com
    === Done!

.. note::
    Depending on how many applications, groups, directories, organizations, and
    accounts you have, this process may take a while.

Once the process is finished, you can navigate the JSON files in the export
directory, which will contain all your Stormpath data.

For full usage information, run ``stormpath-export -h``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ stormpath-export -h
    stormpath-export
    ----------------

    Easily export your Stormpath (https://stormpath.com/) user data.

    Usage:
      stormpath-export configure
      stormpath-export [(<location> | -l <location> | --location <location>)]
      stormpath-export (-h | --help)
      stormpath-export --version

    Options:
      -h --help  Show this screen.
      --version  Show version.
